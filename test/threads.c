//race conditions
//starbucks analogy
//Two threads (the waiters) racing towards a share data (the ledger)

//Ledger -> read value (analogy) -> load operation (computer)
//A load operation in computing is when the CPU reads data from memory (RAM)
//and brings it into its registers so it can use it for processing.
//load = fetch data from memory to CPU -> to work on it.

//Ledger -> write data (analogy) -> store (computer)
//store = CPU â†’ Memory (save data from the CPU back into memory)

//so the solution is to use a lock "for the ledger"


//difference between a thread and a process
//A process is the actual starbucks shop
//threads are the actual workers inside the starbuck accomplishing the mission

//thread share the same memories
//processes are different entities (copy of themselves)

//Race conditions are an intra_process thing

//IT IS NOT an inter-process thing
//child process the ledger is unique in the child
//fater waits for his baby to finish
//the ledger is unique in the father

//so for example a race codition can happen inside the childprocess
