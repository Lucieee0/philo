ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step flow

Main initializes everything â†’ creates philosopher threads + monitor thread.

Philosophers run independently in a loop (think â†’ eat â†’ sleep).

Monitor constantly checks conditions:

If someone dies â†’ set stop = 1.

If all ate enough â†’ set stop = 1.

Philosophers see stop = 1 â†’ exit loop.

Main is blocked on pthread_join until each philosopher thread exits.

Monitor also exits after setting stop, then main joins monitor.

Program ends cleanly after all joins.



ðŸ”‘ In Philosophers project

You create one thread per philosopher.

You create one monitor thread.

Now:

The monitor is the one that decides when the simulation must stop (a philosopher died, or everyone ate enough).

Once that condition is met, the monitor will set a stop flag.

Each philosopher checks that flag in its loop and exits when stop == 1.

So:

Philosophers finish by themselves when the monitor tells them to stop.

Then you join the philosopher threads to clean up properly.

Finally, you join the monitor thread.



ðŸ”¹ Corrected/clarified version of your summary

Parse arguments & initialize table â†’ sets up nbr_philo, times, locks, stop flag, start time.

Create circular linked list of philosophers â†’ each philosopher has its own fork mutex, last_meal_time, thread_id, etc.

Create one thread per philosopher using pthread_create(&philo->thread_id, NULL, philo_routine, philo) â†’ each thread executes the philo routine (think â†’ eat â†’ sleep loop).

Create the monitor thread at the same time â†’ runs monitor_routine.

Monitor checks:

If any philosopher has died (time_to_die exceeded).

If all philosophers ate the required number of meals (optional).

Monitor sets the stop flag (table->stop = 1) when a stopping condition is reached.

Philosopher threads check the stop flag in their loop â†’ exit their routine when stop is set.

Main thread:

Calls pthread_join for each philosopher thread â†’ waits for all philosophers to finish their loop.

Calls pthread_join for monitor thread â†’ waits for monitor to finish.

âœ… Key points:

pthread_join does not stop threads â€” it just waits for them to finish.

Philosophers finish because the monitor told them to stop via the stop flag.

Monitor itself exits after signaling stop (and optionally after joining philosophers if you decide that design).
